I never got a license. It&amp;rsquo;s been ten years since I did my fifteen measly jumps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But those few weeks of ground school, pre-instructed then video-analyzed jumps, and those several thousand bucks, provided both professional and personal lessons that I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about nearly every day since then – and hopefully put to some use. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably never skydive again, but the effect on my outlook has been long-lasting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1-slow-down">1. Slow down&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Skydiving is as safe as the equipment and the mindset of the jumper. New students memorize how to methodically check the equipment before boarding the plane.
We were told to memorize the motion for pulling the ripcord.
We were taught to mentally visualize the landing pattern.
Checklists are known to improve certain detailed processes, such as

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preflight_checklist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aviation&lt;/a>.
In skydiving, I felt safe because I could trust the equipment that I had methodically checked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skydiving is actually safe, and has gotten a lot safer in recent years. According to the United States Parachute Association (USPA), in 2018, there were 13 fatalities for an estimate 3.3 million jumps in the US. That&amp;rsquo;s 3.9 deaths per million jumps. And according to the USPA, tandem skydiving is even safer, with two deaths per million jumps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://smalldata.github.io/images/skydiving_fatalities_dataviz.png" alt="Skydiving Fatalities Dataviz!">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Data source:&lt;/em>
&lt;a href="https://uspa.org/Find/FAQs/Safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USPA&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skydivers are an enthusiastic group, and especially for the skydiver-tourists who have a limited amount of time at the dropzone, you try to maximize the number of jumps while the weather and winds are good.
This means as soon as your feet hit the ground, you run to the parachute packing area, quickly pack, and get back to the plane before it takes off again.
But if it&amp;rsquo;s a safe dropzone and they see you running to the plane, they will not let you board.
And for good reason.
Incorrect equipment usage is a major cause of
&lt;a href="https://www.dropzone.com/fatalities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skydiving fatalities&lt;/a>, including some things so basic as not inserting one&amp;rsquo;s legs into the harness, or even
&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/061807bba937de09d52077b194ee6f54" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mistaking video equipment for a parachute, multiple times&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The harness McGuire wore for the video equipment is similar to that of a parachute. It has the same feel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>My Takeaway:&lt;/em> Being methodical in preparation is a valuable skill. Use checklists to decrease the chances of missing something small but critical. Checklists also decrease your overall
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cognitive load&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2-relax-in-stressful-situations">2. Relax in stressful situations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At some point, every student has to make their first solo jump. As soon as I exited the plane, my first subconscious reaction was Panic. My body went rigid.
I spun out of control, rotating through free fall.
If you open your parachute with this type of movement, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance it gets twisted or tangled and you&amp;rsquo;ll have a hard landing. Opening is better than not-opening, but opening dangerously when you are not stabilized can often lead to serious injury or death. In my first solo jump, until I stabilized, I believed I was going to crash to the ground in an uncontrolled spin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how it looks to not be stabilized:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://smalldata.github.io/images/skydiving_01.png" alt="not how to skydive">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had this exact internal dialog after 5 eternal seconds of uncontrollable aerial rotations:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>What needs to be done?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>     Stabilize the body.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>How does one achieve that?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>     The body must relax.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That realization was an electrocution. To survive, my conscious brain quickly took over from my flailing body. As soon as my body relaxed, it snapped into a safer, stabilized position (although still lacking technique).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>My Takeaway:&lt;/em> Try to regularly take measure of a &amp;ldquo;relaxation-status&amp;rdquo;. If not calm, don&amp;rsquo;t do anything else except take steps to achieve calmness.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="3-dont-blindly-use-technology">3. Don&amp;rsquo;t blindly use technology&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I was sitting at the pre-boarding zone, getting geared-up and ready to board. Skydivers wear
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altimeter#/media/File:Hand-mounted_skydiving_altimeter_with_analogue_display_being_used_in_free_fall.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">altimeters&lt;/a> on their hand, to easily monitor the altitude during the jump, so you know when to pull the ripcord. As I put the altimeter on my hand, it dropped from knee-hight to the ground. &lt;em>No big deal, right?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Wrong.&lt;/strong> An instructor happened to see the altimeter fall, and worse, he saw that I put it on after it fell. He walked over to me and asked me if I was planning to use it. When I said Yes, he asked me to give him the altimeter, and brought me another to use. His thinking, which was 100% correct, was that if there is a miniscule chance that the altimeter was broken or mis-calibrated in the fall, it could mean an accident. The instructor then wore my potentially-broken altimeter in addition to his own, and confirmed after his jump that it was still working correctly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>My Takeaway:&lt;/em> Know when to &lt;em>not&lt;/em> trust the technology, and when the technology needs to be tested. This is especially important on analytical projects, where a result needs to be understood in the context of the data. The worst thing one can do is to make a business case on a faulty analytical presumption.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="4-waiting-may-be-better">4. Waiting may be better&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;stress&amp;rdquo; of skydiving actually causes a hormone response:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Higher post-jump happiness predicted faster cortisol recovery after jumping&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And it&amp;rsquo;s not even just beginner skydivers:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Intriguingly, even after hundreds of prior exposures, the experienced jumpers still showed a significant cortisol response to the jump&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>(&lt;em>Source:
&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4373275/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experience, cortisol reactivity, and the coordination of emotional responses to skydiving&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After my Advanced Free Fall course was complete, I was on my flight back home from the dropzone in Spain. The buzz of new addiction was overwhelming. I did some back-of-the-envelope math to calculate how many jumps I could afford if I quit my job and cashed-in my modest life savings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thankfully, the hormonal response eventually dulled, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t overcome by a skydiving addiction. (Not that there&amp;rsquo;s anything wrong with it.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>My Takeaway:&lt;/em> Waiting to plan is not so good, but waiting to act is perfectly fine. Don&amp;rsquo;t feel pressured to act. It&amp;rsquo;s better to wait until all the information is known, or in this case, until the hormonal response has worn off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An example from my professional life: I worked for an energy utility, and one task was the responsibility for the data-compliance of a European Union regulatory-framework. The deadlines were clear, but as they slowly approached, the exact implementation wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting any clearer. I decided to wait. We were a small player in the market, and I was confident the big Swiss players would iron out the details. The internal response was not so positive, and some may have said that I was procrastinating. But when the deadline arrived, we were fully compliant, and without an over-engineered solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3 id="ten-years-later">Ten years later&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve packed ourselves like sardines, I&amp;rsquo;m nervously sweating in a roaring, ascending plane.
The engine noise becomes slightly quieter: the climb is over.
Light blinks from red to green.
In floods the burst of cold air as the plane door slides open.
Observe as the experienced skydivers fall gracefully from the open door.
Wait for my turn (at the end with the other beginners).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ten years later, these thoughts still make my stomach turn in knots – my moment to jump steadily approaches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And for your entertainment, here&amp;rsquo;s the video of my first solo jump:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Why not
&lt;a href="https://www.dropzone.com/dropzones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go for a jump?&lt;/a> You never know what you&amp;rsquo;ll learn about yourself once your brain has pushed your body out of an airplane!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Healthy hiring (at a cost to diversity?)</title><link>https://smalldata.github.io/posts/smokers-at-work/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smalldata.github.io/posts/smokers-at-work/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently interviewed for a position with a fast-growing startup in food tech. The position checked all my boxes, and because I didn&amp;rsquo;t make it past the interview stage, the following may be some sour grapes 🍇.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something in the text of the job posting stood out to me, and has stuck with me the past few months:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>No smoking:&lt;/strong> You never smell like cigarettes and don’t smoke during the day: &lt;s>XYZ&lt;/s> is about healthy living.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And because this is Switzerland, also in German:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Nichtraucher:&lt;/strong> &lt;s>XYZ&lt;/s> ist eine Nichtraucher Firma, weshalb das Rauchen während der Arbeitszeit nicht erlaubt ist und Du nie nach Rauch riechen darfst.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>and even in French:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Non-fumeur :&lt;/strong> &lt;s>XYZ&lt;/s> est une société “non-fumeur”. Par conséquent fumer durant les heures de travail n’est pas autorisé, tout comme sentir la fumée.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h1 id="is-hiring-only-non-smokers-a-form-of-discrimination">Is hiring only non-smokers a form of discrimination?&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="what-if-instead-the-job-posting-had-written-_our-company-is-about-healthy-living-and-we-dont-hire-overweight-people_-or-people-with-body-odor-due-to-hormonal-or-hygiene-issues-or-people-who-eat-junk-food-or-people-who-drink-excessive-energy-drinks">What if instead the job posting had written &lt;em>our company is about healthy living, and we don&amp;rsquo;t hire overweight people&lt;/em>? Or people with body odor due to hormonal or hygiene issues? Or people who eat junk food? Or people who drink excessive energy drinks?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At what point does &lt;em>healthy&lt;/em> hiring become discrimination? I would say that forcing people to hide their behavior, and to not be themselves, in order to gain employment, is a mild form of discrimination. And if it&amp;rsquo;s not discrimination, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a step toward decreasing diversity in the workplace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not a cigarette smoker, and I don&amp;rsquo;t like smelling cigarette smoke, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be exposed to cigarette smoke at work. But I also want a diverse work environment, where people are comfortable to be themselves. I accept that my co-workers may smoke cigarettes, even during working hours. Life is full of small differences and grievances and part of being a human being, especially when living in a city with so many other human beings, is accepting others as they are, and letting them be free to be themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="heading">🚭&lt;/h1>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Update:&lt;/em> Here&amp;rsquo;s a more scholarly take on the ethics of not hiring smokers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The Ethics of Not Hiring Smokers&amp;rdquo;,
&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1301951?query=TOC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New England Journal of Medicine (2013)&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>tl;dr&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We agree with those polled, believing that categorically refusing to hire smokers is unethical: it results in a failure to care for people, places an additional burden on already-disadvantaged populations, and preempts interventions that more effectively promote smoking cessation.&lt;/p>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I became a first-time father&lt;/strong> around the same time my postdoc contract ended. My wife had another year to finish her PhD, so I took a sabbatical to be a stay-at-home dad. My months away from research were intended to be full of fun projects. And relaxation. It was to be the Year of Naps – or so I thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, while physics problems have solutions that are constant, baby-related problems have solutions that are random and change from day to day. What had worked yesterday will not work today. Maybe it will work tomorrow. This is the gist of the Baby Universe. In this universe, time only means a start and a finish, and contains no information in-between. If the physicist-dad discovers a method to get the baby to eat her breakfast, it is unlikely to work by dinner. This is significant because eating is one of four fundamental dimensions of the Baby Universe, and the same principle of random solutions also applies to the other three: playing, crying and sleeping. (Some scientists consider pooping to be a separate dimension. However, I can assure you that this is always included as part of one of the other four.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>The first challenge&lt;/strong> in my physicist-to-dad transition came with my inability to feed my daughter naturally. My thesis-writing wife&amp;rsquo;s fresh-pumped milk was in demand and its administration required complex algorithms for its optimal, timely use. Solid food, once introduced, posed a whole new set of problems, as each spoonful required extensive parental coercion. This may have had its upsides: recent research shows that the more you talk to your child, the higher the child&amp;rsquo;s IQ will be. The fine print that the researchers don&amp;rsquo;t mention is that this IQ boost comes at your expense, as you must donate those IQ points to the child via non-stop one-way conversations: &amp;ldquo;Look. Yams. Mmmmm. You like yams. You liked yams yesterday. Oooh, yaaaaaams.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later, my daughter acquired a rudimentary ability to feed herself, and the physics of the eating dimension became more complex. If I offer her a spoonful of food, she comes running to see what is on the spoon. If the food is not to her liking, she is scattered like a charged particle from a similarly charged hard sphere. But when, instead, a sticky ball of white rice is presented to her, it triggers a primal urge to make chaos. The &amp;ldquo;entropy of rice&amp;rdquo; principle dictates that the dispersion of rice across a 2D &amp;ldquo;table&amp;rdquo; is sudden, yet erratic. After adequate time, every grain of rice is scattered into a circle with a radius equal to one baby arm. Given infinite time, it is predicted that babies would not rest until every grain of rice was at every end of the universe.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As the preceding paragraph indicates, the &amp;ldquo;eating&amp;rdquo; dimension of the Baby Universe is closely coupled to the &amp;ldquo;playing&amp;rdquo; dimension. Before she could crawl or walk, my daughter would nevertheless want to change her position during playtime. She employed the theory of relativity to satisfy this urge: by moving her playmat from underneath her, she could therefore move herself off the mat. Once mobile, she liked to increase her potential energy by dragging herself up and onto whatever obstacle she could find. If stairs existed, that obstacle was most definitely stairs. This is unfortunate, because although babies understand gravity if they are dropping something (and can even anticipate the &amp;ldquo;Boom!&amp;rdquo; the object makes upon impact), they have no comprehension of gravity if they are the body upon which it is acting. It is therefore the physicist-parent&amp;rsquo;s job to decrease the baby&amp;rsquo;s potential energy whenever it grows too large, and it is the baby&amp;rsquo;s work to regain what was taken away.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbAYEdjcyjc" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;sup>&lt;em>The
&lt;a href="http://www.pechakucha.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PechaKucha&lt;/a> talk that started this research.&lt;/em>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The two remaining dimensions of the Baby Universe &amp;ndash; crying and sleeping &amp;ndash; are also tightly coupled. To deal with daytime crying sessions, I devised a &amp;ldquo;terror threat level&amp;rdquo; system of graded responses, with passivation techniques such as singing, dancing, guitar and something I copied from
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCLp7zodUiI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monty Python&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Ministry of Silly Walks&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>. For inducing sleep, I adopted similarly complex patterns of rocking, bouncing, walking, singing, shushing and waiting. Some of these patterns involved a Swiss ball – a large, inflated exercise ball that serves as a rocking chair for the 21st century. This ball has harmonic degrees of freedom in the side-to-side and front-to-back directions as well as the primary up-and-down one, and is essential for bouncing and rocking a baby to sleep. In addition, it is good for the physicist-parent&amp;rsquo;s core strength, and can be easily deflated and packed up before relocating for yet another postdoc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the baby is asleep, the physicist-parent is faced with the challenge of escaping the room &amp;ndash; in my case over creaky hardwood floors. Doing this before my daughter realizes she is asleep requires knowledge of the &amp;ldquo;path of least noise&amp;rdquo;. Once I have exited the room, though, I have a dilemma. No sounds come from the crib. Is my daughter asleep or awake? A measurement is required. As I silently slide on my socks into the dark room, my measurement wakes her and her original state remains unknown. This is Schrödinger&amp;rsquo;s baby.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>My time at home&lt;/strong> has been a great period in my life and I know I will miss this when I&amp;rsquo;m back at work. As I write this essay in my head, my daughter rests on my shoulder. Her breathing turns to snoring and I synchronize my own breathing to be in phase with hers. Together we plan all the things I need to do during her naptime. I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t have time for a nap of my own.&lt;/p>
