This puzzle was created by brothers Philip and Stephen Shemella.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="the-puzzle">the puzzle&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To solve the puzzle, you are given eight (8) letters. You need to find two commonly-used English words, each with four (4) letters, that could be tattooed across your knuckles. When you fingers are intertwined, the resulting spelling creates two new, commonly-used four letter words. There are often many possibile pairs of words, but only one solution where both the knuckles and the intertwined fingers will result in two sets of valid four-letter words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think of this puzzle like New York Times'
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spelling Bee&lt;/a>, except recursive, and harder on your brain. I suggest using scratch paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are not so many possible puzzles with commonly-used words. That&amp;rsquo;s why I can&amp;rsquo;t give a real, working example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>But here&amp;rsquo;s a hypothetical puzzle&lt;/em>: You are provided the letters&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-txt">A B C D W X Y Z
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If you tattooed &lt;code>ABCD&lt;/code> on one hand, and &lt;code>WXYZ&lt;/code> on the other hand, then one variation of intertwined the fingers would spell &lt;code>AWBX&lt;/code> and &lt;code>CYDZ&lt;/code>. If this were a real example, all four words would be valid.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="rules-of-play">rules of play&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>All words are easily recognizeable and commonly-used English words. Each puzzle has been hand-selected.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>All letters provided in alphabetical order, with many puzzles including letters used more than once.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Hints:
Solving subsequent puzzles should be exponentially faster.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>words across two fists&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ninety percent of baseball is mental; the other half is physical.

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Baseball is a beautiful game of data-driven micro-strategy executed on the field by real-life chess pieces, who spring into action to chase down a fly ball or to sprint around the diamond. For data people like me, who grew up as baseball fans in the US, it&amp;rsquo;s a treasure trove of statistics, extrapolations, trends and trend-defying events. Now that&amp;rsquo;s action!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Baseball is more international than you may think. In addition to the US, it&amp;rsquo;s a top sport in Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Panama, Venezuela, Japan, South Korea and Chinese Taipei (Taiwan). But in Europe, baseball is mostly unknown and mysterious. And boring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, the idea for this article came from a confused chat message in a WhatsApp group from an Australian couple at a baseball game in San Diego.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://smalldata.github.io/images/baseball_whatsapp.jpg" alt="image: WhatsApp screenshot">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As one of the only US-Americans in the group chat, and born and raised into a baseball family, I felt that I needed to share my opinion about &lt;em>discovering&lt;/em> baseball as an adult:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Baseball is a beautiful game of strategy and statistics but I wouldn’t want to have to learn the rules as an adult. Like grammar in a foreign language, it’s built on exceptions to the rule, and those exceptions have their own exceptions (for example, three strikes and you&amp;rsquo;re out, EXCEPT if you hit a foul ball, EXCEPT EXCEPT if that foul ball was hit while bunting).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If you keep reading, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain more about the rules that govern the beautiful game of baseball. To make an article about baseball for non-baseball people less boring, I&amp;rsquo;ll sprinkle in baseball gifs. Here&amp;rsquo;s Ozzie Smith&amp;rsquo;s trademark backflip.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://smalldata.github.io/images/baseball_ozzie_smith_backflip.gif" alt="gif: Ozzie Smith backflip">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If that&amp;rsquo;s too much athleticism for your pre-conceived notions about baseball players being out of shape, how about this &lt;em>professional athlete&lt;/em>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://smalldata.github.io/images/baseball_dadbod.gif" alt="gif: #dadbod">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now to the serious stuff. &lt;strong>How can you learn the rules of baseball as an adult?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tldr-dont-bother">&lt;strong>tl;dr&lt;/strong> don&amp;rsquo;t bother&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Professional Major League Baseball (MLB) has 162 regular season games, and a never-ending post-season of playoffs and a &amp;ldquo;world&amp;rdquo; championship that follow. Then comes Christmas, and the pre-season &amp;ldquo;Spring Training&amp;rdquo; starts. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s a summer sport with a season so long that it can snow at both the beginning AND end of the season.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://smalldata.github.io/images/baseball_snow.gif" alt="gif: snowy game">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The earliest a normal game will start on the East Coast of the US is 1pm, meaning 7pm in Central Europe. Those games are often on Sundays, and it&amp;rsquo;s not a bad time to watch a game if nothing else is on. The remaining 5 to 6 games on the East Coast start at 7pm local time, so 1am in Europe. Games from the West Coast of the US that start at 7pm there will start at 3am in Europe. That means at 6am, when the rest of us are dreaming about waking up, you could turn off the TV and question the decisions you&amp;rsquo;ve made in your life. One-hundred-and-sixty-one more games to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve read this far, and you have the existential craving to know how and why baseball functions, &lt;em>keep reading&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://smalldata.github.io/images/baseball_umpire_flex.gif" alt="gif: umpire flex">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-written-rules">the written rules&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="9-innings">9 innings&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Each game consists of nine innings. An inning gives each team a chance to hit the ball with the bat and score runs (offense), as well as a chance to switch sides and to pitch the ball and try to prevent the other team from scoring runs (defense).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The home team, who is hosting the game, bats in the bottom half or second part of each inning. The visiting team bats in the top half of each inning. The game is exactly 9 innings long.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT: if the home team is winning after 8.5 innings, the game ends after 8.5 innings.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT: if the teams are at a draw after 9.0 innings, then the game shall continue forever. Baseball is a discrete of incremental play, and baseball promises you no end.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT: if a game has started but can&amp;rsquo;t continue due to bad weather, then for the game to be &amp;ldquo;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, then at minimum 5 innings must have been completed. Or 4.5 in case the home team is winning.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT EXCEPT: there are no rain-shortened games in the post-season. All games must be played to completion.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT: if the game has no significance for the post-season, and was started but can&amp;rsquo;t be finished due to weather, and the teams have an equal score after a minimum of 5 innings, it can be deemed a tie by Major League Baseball. There is no room in the standings for a draw, like there is in soccer, so in the
&lt;a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/cubs-pirates-game-suspended-ends-in-tie/c-204121484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rare case that it happens&lt;/a>, the teams show 161 games played but the players have 162 games worth of stats.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="3-outs">3 outs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Each inning, whether the game has 9, or 4.5, or ∞, has six outs. Each team in their half-inning gets three outs. An out can come from: (1) a strikeout, where the batter fails to put the ball into play - more later about strikeouts. The second way to record an out is ground-out, where the ball is hit on the ground and the defensive player either (2a) tags the player with the ball either with the glove hand if the ball is in the glove, or with the ball in the non-glove hand, or (2b) throws to a base where a runner is forced to run and the player who catches the ball touches the base with any part of his body (perhaps a toe).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of a pathetic ground-out that was an embarrassment to even the player&amp;rsquo;s mom and grandma.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://smalldata.github.io/images/baseball_ground_out.gif" alt="gif: ground out">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The third way to record an out is a fly-out (3a) to the outfield or a pop-out (3b) to the infield. In this case, the ball is hit in the air and caught by a player without touching the ground.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s possible to get more than one out per play, for example a triple play, where all three outs of the inning are recorded in one play. It&amp;rsquo;s not very common. Double plays are more common and a great way to kill your team&amp;rsquo;s momentum by canceling out baserunners.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So three outs to a half-inning, and three ways to make an out. If you&amp;rsquo;re a baserunner, you can also make an out by being tagged out when you aren&amp;rsquo;t touching the base. But let&amp;rsquo;s skip that for now.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT: ground-outs (out-type #2) must be inside the field of play, or between the painted white lines that are first and third base.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT: Fly-outs (3a) and pop-outs (3b) can be either fair or foul - basically anywhere the players can reach, including the stands.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT EXCEPT: According to the &amp;ldquo;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infield_fly_rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infield fly rule&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, if there are one or more runners on bases that would be forced to run when the ball is hit, and the ball is hit in the air near enough to the runners that the fielder could drop the ball on purpose or pretend to fail to catch the ball, or actually fail to catch the ball, so as to create a double or triple play, than the umpire can call the hitter out and the runners are allowed to stay on their base.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT EXCEPT: Foul balls in the air that are first caught by a fan do not count as outs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://smalldata.github.io/images/baseball_fan_interference.gif" alt="gif: Foul ball?">&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT: If the ball is touched by a fan in the field of play, and affects the course of the game, the umpire can decide what to do. It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_%28baseball%29#Spectator_interference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spectator interference&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; and as stadiums have recently been built to put fans close to the action, it happens often.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>One
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bartman_incident" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infamous example&lt;/a> prolonged the 71 year-old &amp;ldquo;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Billy_Goat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Curse of the Billy Goat&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; on the Chicago Cubs, and made Steve Bartman a pariah in Chicago. Did I mention that baseball players and fans are
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_superstition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">superstitious&lt;/a>? Did you know if you wear a &amp;ldquo;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_cap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rally cap&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, you can impact the outcome of the game from the sidelines?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://smalldata.github.io/images/baseball_rally_cap.jpg" alt="image: Rally Cap">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With all those exceptions, the one thing is constant. A half-inning has three outs. Right?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>EXCEPT: An inning can have a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four outs&lt;/a>. I had never heard of this rule, so I asked a serious baseball fan.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://smalldata.github.io/images/baseball_fourth_out.png" alt="image: Fourth out">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s skip this one.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="3-strikes">3 strikes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Balls thrown by the pitcher are categorized by the home-plate umpire as either balls or strikes. You may have heard the cliché &lt;em>Three strikes and you&amp;rsquo;re out&lt;/em>. A batter is indeed &lt;em>out&lt;/em> if they have three from the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>swing and miss&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>swing and hit the ball out of play (a.k.a. foul ball)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>don&amp;rsquo;t swing but the pitch is determined a strike by the umpire, for passing over the home-plate between the knees and chest-high &amp;ldquo;letters&amp;rdquo; of the hitter.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Well, that&amp;rsquo;s true most of the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT: The batter is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> out if the 3rd strike is a foul ball. The first two strikes can come from foul balls, but the third strike can&amp;rsquo;t come from a foul ball. And the hitter can remain hitting as long as they can hit foul balls. Baseball again approaches the infinite.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT EXCEPT: If 3rd strike is made with a bunting attempt, specifically running a hand up the bat to tap the ball into the field of play, and that bunted attempt goes foul, then the 3rd strike counts and an &lt;em>out&lt;/em> is recorded.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT: If the 3rd strike is recorded and the catcher, who catches the ball thrown by the pitcher, drops or misses the ball, then the batter is entitled to run to first base, and the catcher or another defense player may try to throw the ball to first base. If a position player tags first base with the ball before the hitter reaches first base, then the out is recored. Otherwise, no out is recorded and the hitter remains at first base.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT: If first base is already occupied, then the batter may not attempt to reach first base.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT: If first base is occupied, but if there are already two outs, then the batter may attempt to reach first base, and the previous occupant of first base must attempt to advance to second base.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT: to quote directly from the rulebook&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Rule 5.09(a)(2)   Comment: A batter who does not realize his situation on a third strike not caught, and who is not in the process of running to first base, shall be declared out once he leaves the dirt circle surrounding home plate&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The rule is called &amp;ldquo;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncaught_third_strike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the dropped third strike&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, if you insist to know more. Here&amp;rsquo;s the full 184 page rulebook (
&lt;a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/documents/0/8/0/268272080/2018_Official_Baseball_Rules.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pdf&lt;/a>), in case you can stand any more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rulebook contains such thrilling excerpts as:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>**3.07 Pitcher’s Glove(a) &lt;em>The pitcher’s glove may not, exclusive of piping, be white,gray, nor, in the judgment of an umpire, distracting in any manner. No fielder, regardless of position, may use a fielding glove that falls within a PANTONE® color set lighter than the current 14-series.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="hit-by-pitch">hit-by-pitch&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If the batter is hit by the pitched ball, then he/she is awarded first base.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT: if umpire determines that the pitch was a strike, despite hitting the batter. This means that it was over the plate and between the knees and the &amp;ldquo;letters&amp;rdquo;. In this case, a strike is called.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT: if the batter swings at a pitch, even if it still hits him/her.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>EXCEPT: if the umpire determines that the batter did not make an effort to avoid being hit by the pitch.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-unwritten-rules">the unwritten rules&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Wikipedia has an entire article about the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unwritten_rules_of_baseball" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unwritten rules of baseball&lt;/a>. Many are about respecting the game, and violating the rules can get cause the opposing pitcher to intentionally hit one of your players with the ball.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>EXCEPT: the pitcher shouldn&amp;rsquo;t throw at the head of the hitter&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In turn, throwing at a hitter can also cause a bench-clearing brawl. I don&amp;rsquo;t condone violence, but all I can say is that if you charge the mound, at least know the skills of the player you are going after.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://smalldata.github.io/images/baseball_nolan_ryan_headlock.gif" alt="headlock">&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="make-it-stop">make it stop&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At this point, you may feel like you are in a headlock and being punched repeatedly in the head.
Let&amp;rsquo;s agree that it&amp;rsquo;s easier to ignore all the rules, written and unwritten, and their exceptions, and their exceptions to their exceptions.
We can still enjoy the game. Go to a stadium, enjoy the summer weather, cheer with the fans, eat a hot dog, drink a beer, and if you do all of this in in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, you may even get to see sausages in a footrace.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>I became a first-time father&lt;/strong> around the same time my postdoc contract ended. My wife had another year to finish her PhD, so I took a sabbatical to be a stay-at-home dad. My months away from research were intended to be full of fun projects. And relaxation. It was to be the Year of Naps – or so I thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, while physics problems have solutions that are constant, baby-related problems have solutions that are random and change from day to day. What had worked yesterday will not work today. Maybe it will work tomorrow. This is the gist of the Baby Universe. In this universe, time only means a start and a finish, and contains no information in-between. If the physicist-dad discovers a method to get the baby to eat her breakfast, it is unlikely to work by dinner. This is significant because eating is one of four fundamental dimensions of the Baby Universe, and the same principle of random solutions also applies to the other three: playing, crying and sleeping. (Some scientists consider pooping to be a separate dimension. However, I can assure you that this is always included as part of one of the other four.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>The first challenge&lt;/strong> in my physicist-to-dad transition came with my inability to feed my daughter naturally. My thesis-writing wife&amp;rsquo;s fresh-pumped milk was in demand and its administration required complex algorithms for its optimal, timely use. Solid food, once introduced, posed a whole new set of problems, as each spoonful required extensive parental coercion. This may have had its upsides: recent research shows that the more you talk to your child, the higher the child&amp;rsquo;s IQ will be. The fine print that the researchers don&amp;rsquo;t mention is that this IQ boost comes at your expense, as you must donate those IQ points to the child via non-stop one-way conversations: &amp;ldquo;Look. Yams. Mmmmm. You like yams. You liked yams yesterday. Oooh, yaaaaaams.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later, my daughter acquired a rudimentary ability to feed herself, and the physics of the eating dimension became more complex. If I offer her a spoonful of food, she comes running to see what is on the spoon. If the food is not to her liking, she is scattered like a charged particle from a similarly charged hard sphere. But when, instead, a sticky ball of white rice is presented to her, it triggers a primal urge to make chaos. The &amp;ldquo;entropy of rice&amp;rdquo; principle dictates that the dispersion of rice across a 2D &amp;ldquo;table&amp;rdquo; is sudden, yet erratic. After adequate time, every grain of rice is scattered into a circle with a radius equal to one baby arm. Given infinite time, it is predicted that babies would not rest until every grain of rice was at every end of the universe.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As the preceding paragraph indicates, the &amp;ldquo;eating&amp;rdquo; dimension of the Baby Universe is closely coupled to the &amp;ldquo;playing&amp;rdquo; dimension. Before she could crawl or walk, my daughter would nevertheless want to change her position during playtime. She employed the theory of relativity to satisfy this urge: by moving her playmat from underneath her, she could therefore move herself off the mat. Once mobile, she liked to increase her potential energy by dragging herself up and onto whatever obstacle she could find. If stairs existed, that obstacle was most definitely stairs. This is unfortunate, because although babies understand gravity if they are dropping something (and can even anticipate the &amp;ldquo;Boom!&amp;rdquo; the object makes upon impact), they have no comprehension of gravity if they are the body upon which it is acting. It is therefore the physicist-parent&amp;rsquo;s job to decrease the baby&amp;rsquo;s potential energy whenever it grows too large, and it is the baby&amp;rsquo;s work to regain what was taken away.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;sup>&lt;em>The
&lt;a href="http://www.pechakucha.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PechaKucha&lt;/a> talk that started this research.&lt;/em>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The two remaining dimensions of the Baby Universe &amp;ndash; crying and sleeping &amp;ndash; are also tightly coupled. To deal with daytime crying sessions, I devised a &amp;ldquo;terror threat level&amp;rdquo; system of graded responses, with passivation techniques such as singing, dancing, guitar and something I copied from
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCLp7zodUiI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monty Python&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Ministry of Silly Walks&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>. For inducing sleep, I adopted similarly complex patterns of rocking, bouncing, walking, singing, shushing and waiting. Some of these patterns involved a Swiss ball – a large, inflated exercise ball that serves as a rocking chair for the 21st century. This ball has harmonic degrees of freedom in the side-to-side and front-to-back directions as well as the primary up-and-down one, and is essential for bouncing and rocking a baby to sleep. In addition, it is good for the physicist-parent&amp;rsquo;s core strength, and can be easily deflated and packed up before relocating for yet another postdoc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the baby is asleep, the physicist-parent is faced with the challenge of escaping the room &amp;ndash; in my case over creaky hardwood floors. Doing this before my daughter realizes she is asleep requires knowledge of the &amp;ldquo;path of least noise&amp;rdquo;. Once I have exited the room, though, I have a dilemma. No sounds come from the crib. Is my daughter asleep or awake? A measurement is required. As I silently slide on my socks into the dark room, my measurement wakes her and her original state remains unknown. This is Schrödinger&amp;rsquo;s baby.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>My time at home&lt;/strong> has been a great period in my life and I know I will miss this when I&amp;rsquo;m back at work. As I write this essay in my head, my daughter rests on my shoulder. Her breathing turns to snoring and I synchronize my own breathing to be in phase with hers. Together we plan all the things I need to do during her naptime. I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t have time for a nap of my own.&lt;/p>
