I recently interviewed for a position with a fast-growing startup in food tech. The position checked all my boxes, and because I didn't make it past the interview stage, the following may be some sour grapes 🍇.

Something in the text of the job posting stood out to me, and has stuck with me the past few months:

> **No smoking:** You never smell like cigarettes and don’t smoke during the day: <s>XYZ</s> is about healthy living.

And because this is Switzerland, also in German:

> **Nichtraucher:** <s>XYZ</s> ist eine Nichtraucher Firma, weshalb das Rauchen während der Arbeitszeit nicht erlaubt ist und Du nie nach Rauch riechen darfst.

and even in French:

> **Non-fumeur :** <s>XYZ</s> est une société “non-fumeur”. Par conséquent fumer durant les heures de travail n’est pas autorisé, tout comme sentir la fumée.


# Is hiring only non-smokers a form of discrimination?

## What if instead the job posting had written _our company is about healthy living, and we don't hire overweight people_? Or people with body odor due to hormonal or hygiene issues? Or people who eat junk food? Or people who drink excessive energy drinks?

At what point does _healthy_ hiring become discrimination? I would say that forcing people to hide their behavior, and to not be themselves, in order to gain employment, is a mild form of discrimination. And if it's not discrimination, it's definitely a step toward decreasing diversity in the workplace.

Now... I'm not a cigarette smoker, and I don't like smelling cigarette smoke, and I don't want to be exposed to cigarette smoke at work. But I also want a diverse work environment, where people are comfortable to be themselves. I accept that my co-workers may smoke cigarettes, even during working hours. Life is full of small differences and grievances and part of being a human being, especially when living in a city with so many other human beings, is accepting others as they are, and letting them be free to be themselves.

*Update:* Here's a more scholarly take on the ethics of not hiring smokers.

"The Ethics of Not Hiring Smokers", [New England Journal of Medicine (2013)](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1301951?query=TOC)

**tl;dr**

> We agree with those polled, believing that categorically refusing to hire smokers is unethical: it results in a failure to care for people, places an additional burden on already-disadvantaged populations, and preempts interventions that more effectively promote smoking cessation.
