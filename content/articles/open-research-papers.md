*In my definition of Open Anything, "open" is an imperative verb.*

Unless you are an academic publisher, you're probably not a big fan of for-profit academic publishing.

The business model of many journals is to charge the authors publication fees, and then charge the readers access fees. Double dipping - it's what the credit card companies do.

What's happening as a response? [Universities are dropping subscriptions](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00758-x).

> The move is the latest in an escalating global row between scholarly publishers and academic institutions, which are pushing to make more of the scientific literature freely available and say that the costs of publishers’ subscriptions are becoming unreasonably expensive.

[And non-legal portals like sci-hub.tw are springing up](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17688336).

Open access to academic research is not only important for top universities like UC Berkley, it's essential for researchers around the world. A few examples that come to mind: 

+ amateurs and hobbyists

+ citizen science and community groups

+ high school students or others without university library access

+ researchers in developing economies

+ those doing machine learning projects on bulk academic papers

## Creating a self-archive

I've read the articles about Elsevier and Springer but since I'm not publishing anymore, I hadn't made much connection to my role in open access research.

But for a freelance data-project I'm working on with an NGO, I have to match citation metadata and full text PDF for more accurate screening, both manual and with machine learning. Getting full-text PDFs is a tiresome process, and we are looking for 1000s of papers.

Despite that my academic publishing ended 7 years ago, I wasn't sure if my old research papers were openly available. Some of [my papers]([google scholar](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=SczBp6kAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1&oi=ao)
) are still being cited! (Actually, I had to dig deep to find my PDF copies!)

It turns out that I still do have PDF copies, and that many of my old papers are not easily available to the public.

Authors are [allowed to share copies of post-prints](https://tomsaunders.co.nz/how-to-make-your-research-open-access/), and so that is what I'm finally doing.

## Handy tools for creating a self-archive

+ [Export Pubmed citations as BibTex format](https://www.bioinformatics.org/texmed/)

+ [Tidy up and standardize BibTex format](https://flamingtempura.github.io/bibtex-tidy/)

+ [Archive your archive on the wayback machine](https://blog.archive.org/2017/01/25/see-something-save-something/)
