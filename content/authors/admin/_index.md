**...the person**

I'm Philip Shemella, a full-stack business intelligence and data analyst professional. I have a PhD in Computational Physics. In my career, I've gained experience with startups, cloud computing, dataops, consulting and mentoring. Based in Zürich, Switzerland, I am active in the civic tech, open data and data visualization communities.

I have a good day-job, but I do have availability for **small DATA** projects. [Get in touch!](/#contact)

**...this page**

is built using the static site generator [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) with the theme [Academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic). Browse the [open source code](https://github.com/philshem/smalldata.github.io).

This site uses no trackers, no logging and no analytics. I have no idea about visitors and traffic. For that reason, I especially appreciate your feedback.
