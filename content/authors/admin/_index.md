**...the person**

I'm Philip Shemella, a full-stack data professional. I have a PhD in Computational Physics. In my career so far, I've gained experience with data analysis, business intelligence, startups, cloud computing, dataops, consulting and mentoring. Based in Zürich, Switzerland, I am active in the civic tech, open data and data visualization communities.

<!--I have a good day-job, but I do have availability for **small DATA** projects.-->

This site uses no trackers, no logging and no analytics. I have no idea about visitors and traffic. For that reason, I especially appreciate your feedback.
