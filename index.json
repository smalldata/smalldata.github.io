You need to find two commonly-used English words, each with four (4) letters, that could be tattooed across your knuckles. When you fingers are intertwined, the resulting spelling creates two new, commonly-used four letter words. There are often many possibile pairs of words, but only one solution where both the knuckles and the intertwined fingers will result in two sets of valid four-letter words.\nThink of this puzzle like New York Times' Spelling Bee, except recursive, and harder on your brain.

And one of those SQLite databases happens to be your browsing history. As a short proof-of-concept, here\u0026rsquo;s how to access the history of your Firefox browser via the SQLite database.\nfind your database file Mozilla Firefox stores your cookies, bookmarks, form inputs, and browsing history under the path defined in your profile settings. To find the path of those files in your file system, visit about:profiles in a Firefox window.\nIn my case, I only use really one profile, which is shown in the orange box.\nYou can click \u0026ldquo;Show in Finder\u0026rdquo; and then scroll down to the file places.sqlite. Trying to directly open this database file gives the error \u0026ldquo;locked database\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; you\u0026rsquo;ll need to make a copy of the file in a different folder before opening.\nexplore the database The go-to SQLite client is DB Browser for SQLite. Once installed, you can easily open your places.sqlite file with \u0026ldquo;Open With\u0026rdquo; from Finder.\nOnce the database file is open, you\u0026rsquo;ll see 13 tables\nAfter digging through a couple tables, the one with your browsing history is called moz_places. By viewing this table, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that the field url stores the page visited, and last visit date is the UNIX timestamp of the last visit.\nSort descending by visit_count and you\u0026rsquo;ll find your most commonly viewed website. For me, it\u0026rsquo;s HackerNews, and then various permutations of Twitter. (I use the mobile Twitter site instead of the app, and I sync my history between devices.)\nquery the database Despite using Twitter, I\u0026rsquo;m a private person, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to share any real analysis of my browsing history. I do want to share one result: the distribution of http://localhost ports. Here\u0026rsquo;s a short python3 script that reads the copy of the place.sqlite file, and returns a count of localhost ports from the browsing history.\nimport pandas as pd import sqlite3 # connect and read database con = sqlite3.connect('places.sqlite') df = pd.read_sql_query('select * from moz_places', con) con.close() #¬†filter for urls containing localhost # notice I include ':', which means a port should be defined df = df[df.url.str.contains('localhost:',case=False)] # parse the url to get just the port df.port = df.url.str.split(':').str[-1].str.split('/').str[0] # keep only port column and do a count by grouping each port df = df.port df = df.groupby(df).count() print(df.to_markdown())  Here\u0026rsquo;s the results, with my annotation:\n   port count description     1313 144 Hugo devserver - this site!   3000 41 Metabase (?), which I tested a while ago   5000 4 Flask web server (work stuff)   50222 1 Callback for Tableau authentication   58595 1 Not sure, but probably similar to 50222   8000 137 Old faithful, in this case mkdocs (work stuff)   8888 37 Jupyter notebook server   8889 4 Jupyter notebook server   9005 1 Callback for Firebase CLI authentication    7 No port means URL had multiple :. See below.    Similar aggregation could be done directly in SQL:\nselect port, count(1) from ( select url, replace( replace( substr(url, instr(url, 'localhost:'), 15), 'localhost:' , ''), '/', '') as port from moz_places where url like '%localhost:%' ) group by port  which generates almost identical results.\nThe SQL query picked up one instance of localhost:9005 that the Python script didn\u0026rsquo;t find.\nDigging deeper:\nselect * from moz_places where url like '%localhost:9005%'  shows that port 9005 was used for the Callback on Firebase CLI authentication. The reason is because the Python script splits on the : character, for which this URL has more than one. The table shows 7 localhost URLs without ports, but these are actually URLs that have more than one : character. I\u0026rsquo;ve updated the table above, but not the Python script.\nconclusion Everything is a SQLite database.\n","date":1600387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600387200,"objectID":"8a2e8d72ecb1368049f0d1b2fd462f5a","permalink":"https://smalldata.github.io/posts/browsing-stats/","publishdate":"2020-09-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posts/browsing-stats/","section":"posts","summary":"If you didn\u0026rsquo;t know, there are more SQLite databases in the universe ( 1+ trillion) than there are known galaxies ( 100 billion).

In that folder, I wanted to have sub-folders for each year within a range: tmp_dates/2020/. And sub-folders for months: tmp_dates/2020/06/. And sub-folders for days: tmp_dates/2020/06/30.\nsmart calendar dates and leap years Using Python\u0026rsquo;s standard datetime library, I can easily generate date ranges with timedelta(). This is necessary for generating \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo;-dates that take into account varying days per month, as well as those pesky leap years. It turns out that the rules for leap years are not as simple as years that are multiples of 4. Sadly, for those of us born in the late 20th Century, we won\u0026rsquo;t be alive to see a year divisible by 4 that is not a leap year. The next one of those is year 2100. The year 2000 was a leap year despite being divisible by 100 because it was also divisible by 400.\nWrapping the date-range functionality with Pandas makes the code extremely efficient. Here\u0026rsquo;s an adapted StackOverflow snippet which does the heavy lifting.\nimport pandas as pd from datetime import date, timedelta sdate = date(2000,1,1) # start date edate = date.today() # end date df = pd.date_range(sdate,edate-timedelta(days=1),freq='d')  generating (sub-)folders based on a date range In addition to generating the date-folders, I want my code to create folders but not overwrite files if a folder exists. For this I used this snippet that uses the wonderful new Python3 library pathlib.Path() to create a folder called tmp_dates/ in the current working directory. If that folder already exists, it will otherwise ignored.\nfrom pathlib import Path Path('tmp_dates/').mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)  adding an empty file to each folder Git can\u0026rsquo;t handle an empty directory. To include empty directories, on Github at least, there is an undocumented feature where an empty folder that has the empty file .gitkeep will be included in the version control. The pathlib.Path() library can even create an empty file, using the .touch() function, which copies its functionality from the Unix touch command.\nfrom pathlib import Path Path('tmp_dates/').mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) Path('tmp_dates/'+os.sep+'.gitkeep').touch()  putting it all together All that\u0026rsquo;s left is to combine all the pieces into one Python3 script that safely generates sub-folders for individual calendar dates in a date range.\nfrom datetime import date, timedelta import pandas as pd from pathlib import Path #requires Python\u0026gt;=3.5 import os # safe generate folders for all dates within a range def create_folder(p): Path(p).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) Path(p+os.sep+'.gitkeep').touch() # where to start to put the many folders subpath = 'tmp_dates' # start and end date sdate = date(2000,1,1) # start date edate = date.today() # end date # use pandas for the heavy lifting of building the calendar-aware date range df = pd.date_range(sdate,edate-timedelta(days=1),freq='d') # loop over all values and create a folder for each possible date for d in df: #print(d.year, d.month, d.day) path = subpath + os.sep + str(d.year).zfill(4) + os.sep + str(d.month).zfill(2) + os.sep + str(d.day).zfill(2) create_folder(path) #break # debugging  ","date":1598832e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598832e3,"objectID":"d2e9e5f61b7fad412344a64da0125768","permalink":"https://smalldata.github.io/posts/python-date-folders/","publishdate":"2020-08-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posts/python-date-folders/","section":"posts","summary":"Not everything your mother told you is true.\n \u0026ndash;my CompSci 101 professor, when a student insisted that, without exception, every 4th year was a leap year\n the idea For a hobby project, I needed to generate thousands folders and sub-folders and sub-sub-folders based on calendar dates within a range.","tags":["python","coding"],"title":"Generating folders with smart dates in Python + Pandas","type":"posts"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Step 0. The disclaimers   I don\u0026rsquo;t call myself a data scientist, but other people do, and I wanted to share my approach to data science. This approach has worked well for me professionally. There are many good approaches, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to gatekeep any of those.\n  PAW Patrol is a registered trademark of someone else. I don\u0026rsquo;t own any rights to PAW Patrol. If I did, I would be doing something better with my free time.\n  Step 1. Start with the science Thinking like a scientist means having a question, and then searching out an answer. Science isn\u0026rsquo;t data-driven, in that the data can provide an answer, but the available data shouldn\u0026rsquo;t suggest the question. At least in most of the cases I can think of.\nThis is a huge challenge to productionalize data science in a business environment. With a recent (unnamed) employer, we had a big data-engineering effort to rebuild an analysis pipeline. As an analyst, it became slowly clear that with the new pipeline, we could only recreate 5 of the 6 key metrics. I left the company before the proposed workaround was implemented.\nFor my example of methodology, I\u0026rsquo;ll use PAW Patrol. It\u0026rsquo;s a kids' animated TV series. To describe cast of characters, and the plot, here are the lyrics to the theme song:\n PAW Patrol, PAW Patrol\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll be there on the double\nWhenever there\u0026rsquo;s a problem\n\u0026lsquo;Round Adventure Bay\nRyder and his team of pups\nWill come and save the day\nMarshall, Rubble, Chase\nRocky, Zuma, Skye\nYeah! They\u0026rsquo;re on the way!\n Yeah. It goes on. You get the point. But the show can be endearing, and I think the deeper reason it resonates with kids is because the team is useful and appreciated by the adults they help. But that\u0026rsquo;s a topic for another article. [1]\nIf you take a vote in my household, a consensus of 50% of voters will declare PAW Patrol to be the single best achievement of humanity. And it\u0026rsquo;s been decided, by compromise, that if we ever get a pet dog, the name shall be either Zuma-Marshall, or Marshall-Zuma.\nThe question I was curious - with PAW Patrol hype slowly sweeping the planet since 2013, do we see an increase in dogs named after the crew?\nStep 2. Curate the data I need open data with pet names. Dog names. There are several, and I\u0026rsquo;ll outline why they make a good or bad candidate for the analysis.\nHundenamen aus dem Hundebestand der Stadt Z√ºrich This one is from the city of Z√ºrich, Switzerland, where I live. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a recent Twitter post about this dataset, so that may have planted the idea that dog names can be open data.\nData goes back to 2015, and each year is one CSV file. To get an idea of the dataset size, I choose the complete year of 2019. 7647 records. It may be hard to find trends in so few dog registrations. Additionally, the Paw Patrol trend is slowly making it here to Switzerland. Since it started in North America, I\u0026rsquo;ll go to look there.\nAnchorage Dog Names over Time Only 16k total names between 2017 and 2019. That\u0026rsquo;s not enough dogs when there are so many possible names. And starting in 2017, I may not get a good before snapshot.\nSeattle Pet Licenses  A list of active/current Seattle pet licenses, including animal type (species), pet\u0026rsquo;s name, breed and the owner\u0026rsquo;s ZIP code.\n This might be a good dataset because records go back to 2000 and are updated through 2019. I can get snapshots before and during the PAW Patrol era. But I counted dogs registered in 2019 and it was 11k. In 2018, 7k. Still not enough.\nNYC Dog Licensing Dataset This could be it. Recently updated. 24.1 MB CSV file. 345k total rows going back more than 10 years. 79k dog registrations in 2019. Explore the data here.\nThe fine print:\n Each record stands as a unique license period for the dog over the course of the yearlong time frame.\n What does this mean for my data? It means that dog names are assigned at least once per year. If I count unique dog names over multiple years, I\u0026rsquo;ll be over counting.\nand\n Each record represents a unique dog license that was active during the year, but not necessarily a unique record per dog, since a license that is renewed during the year results in a separate record of an active license period.\n This means that dog-names within a given year may actually be duplicate as well. If this was a real project, in order to fully trust my data, I would first count how many names are repeated. To do this, because there is no column dog ID which would uniquely identify a dog, I would have to create a surrogate key based on the columns such as AnimalBirthMonth, AnimalGender and BreedName, and perhaps also the geographical data Borough and ZipCode.\nIf I cared more about PAW Patrol pet-naming theory, I could build a unified dog-name data-model and combine datasets, and keep looking for new sources to add. Maybe even make some FOIA requests. But I don\u0026rsquo;t care that much. On to the answer. Let\u0026rsquo;s hope NYC is a trend-setter \u0026ndash; when it comes to naming pets after kids\u0026rsquo; cartoon superheros.\nStep 3. Explore the data Lots of tools but because I know that I won\u0026rsquo;t productionalize this pipeline, I\u0026rsquo;m going to dump the data into the commercial BI tool Tableau Desktop. Licenses are expensive, and there are many solid open source tools that will do the job. But the software allows me to do fast visual anaylsis. If you sign up for the free audit of this Coursera, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that after clicking through the 3rd week or so, you are provided a 6-month software license to complete the rest of the course. YMMV.\nVisual Analysis In this step, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to get a feel for the data. Is it clean, is it reliable? Will it answer my question?\nWhat are the 5 most common names for dogs in NYC?\n   Name Frequency     UNKNOWN 5379   BELLA 3824   NAME NOT PROVIDED 3763   MAX 3582   CHARLIE 2852   COCO 2636    Woof. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot of NULL. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how it\u0026rsquo;s evenly distributed throughout the years\n   AnimalName 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018     UNKNOWN 3 1179 1903 1294 1000   BELLA 19 427 1332 1233 813   NAME NOT PROVIDED 11 963 1374 847 568   MAX 34 444 1214 1166 724   CHARLIE 26 293 1027 935 571   COCO 22 296 941 817 560    OK, better. It seems pretty flat, except for 2014. Let\u0026rsquo;s do a quick check of total names per year, to see that indeed 2014 has many fewer.\n   Year of LicenseIssuedDate Frequency     2014 2650   2015 42439   2016 119080   2017 110995   2018 70563    Bummer that 2019 registrations aren\u0026rsquo;t there yet. I hope NYC is trend-setting enough to show a signal in 2018.\nAnother learning is that we should exclude 2014 from the calculation \u0026ndash; there are just not enough records, especially in comparison with other years.\nInitial Calculation I want to start to measure trends, and I\u0026rsquo;ll do so visually, since I need to only compare a handful of names.\nMarshall, Rubble, Chase, Rocky, Zuma and Skye. Let\u0026rsquo;s add Ryder, even though he is a human in the cartoon. And the pups added in later seasons: Everest and Tracker.\n   AnimalName 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018     CHASE 7 49 115 170 86   EVEREST  1 9 5 3   MARSHALL  7 26 19 11   ROCKY 20 300 823 785 486   RUBBLE    6 2   RYDER  13 28 26 18   SKYE  10 61 54 36   TRACKER     1   ZUMA  2 2 2 2    A couple things to notice. There aren\u0026rsquo;t enough Trackers, Rubbles or Zumas to use in any analysis. And Everest probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t have enough data to compare, either, especially since she was a late addition to the pack.\nAnd because the yearly totals of registrations varies so greatly, I need to normalize my data. This means that I take the count of each unique name and divide by the total dogs registered in that year. Noticing that Rocky is the most popular from my list, and that in 2016 there were 823 Rockies registered, from a total of 119,080 registrations, I want to normalize for the prevalence of each name to a fixed integer, so that I can compare years. In effect, how popular a certain name was in that year. The metric is then be frequency of dog-name per 10000 dogs.\nClosing the calculation The math doesn\u0026rsquo;t get too complicated, because the data doesn\u0026rsquo;t require anything else. I\u0026rsquo;m going to use my normalized frequency metric to compare trends for Chase, Marshall, Rocky, Ryder, Rocky and Skye.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve removed 2016 and 2017 now too, to try to more clearly show before and after. It\u0026rsquo;s only Skye that shows any trend \u0026ndash; effectively doubling in popularity.\nStep 4. Shutting it down I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I\u0026rsquo;ve spent this much time thinking about PAW Patrol. What I want to stress is that when you are working with data, for me it has been essential to\n  Understand the subject matter. In this case, that means passively absorbing all things PAW Patrol.\n  Get dirty with the data. If you try to plug an algorithm on top of data, it\u0026rsquo;s unlikely to give any meaningful results. Can you imagine creating a fancy data pipeline that spits out the 3 most popular dog names? UNKNOWN, BELLA and NAME NOT PROVIDED.\n  In case you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard it already, here\u0026rsquo;s their theme song. I\u0026rsquo;ve been singing it to myself as I write this, and I hope it gets stuck in your head, too.\n  üê∂ü¶¥ And remember\u0026ndash;Whenever there‚Äôs trouble, just yelp for help!

How can you learn the rules of baseball as an adult?\ntl;dr don\u0026rsquo;t bother Professional Major League Baseball (MLB) has 162 regular season games, and a never-ending post-season of playoffs and a \u0026ldquo;world\u0026rdquo; championship that follow. Then comes Christmas, and the pre-season \u0026ldquo;Spring Training\u0026rdquo; starts. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s a summer sport with a season so long that it can snow at both the beginning AND end of the season.\nThe earliest a normal game will start on the East Coast of the US is 1pm, meaning 7pm in Central Europe. Those games are often on Sundays, and it\u0026rsquo;s not a bad time to watch a game if nothing else is on. The remaining 5 to 6 games on the East Coast start at 7pm local time, so 1am in Europe. Games from the West Coast of the US that start at 7pm there will start at 3am in Europe. That means at 6am, when the rest of us are dreaming about waking up, you could turn off the TV and question the decisions you\u0026rsquo;ve made in your life. One-hundred-and-sixty-one more games to go.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve read this far, and you have the existential craving to know how and why baseball functions, keep reading.\nthe written rules 9 innings Each game consists of nine innings. An inning gives each team a chance to hit the ball with the bat and score runs (offense), as well as a chance to switch sides and to pitch the ball and try to prevent the other team from scoring runs (defense).\nThe home team, who is hosting the game, bats in the bottom half or second part of each inning. The visiting team bats in the top half of each inning. The game is exactly 9 innings long.\n  EXCEPT: if the home team is winning after 8.5 innings, the game ends after 8.5 innings.\n  EXCEPT: if the teams are at a draw after 9.0 innings, then the game shall continue forever. Baseball is a discrete of incremental play, and baseball promises you no end.\n  EXCEPT: if a game has started but can\u0026rsquo;t continue due to bad weather, then for the game to be \u0026ldquo; official\u0026rdquo;, then at minimum 5 innings must have been completed. Or 4.5 in case the home team is winning.\n  EXCEPT EXCEPT: there are no rain-shortened games in the post-season. All games must be played to completion.\n  EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT: if the game has no significance for the post-season, and was started but can\u0026rsquo;t be finished due to weather, and the teams have an equal score after a minimum of 5 innings, it can be deemed a tie by Major League Baseball. There is no room in the standings for a draw, like there is in soccer, so in the rare case that it happens, the teams show 161 games played but the players have 162 games worth of stats.\n  3 outs Each inning, whether the game has 9, or 4.5, or ‚àû, has six outs. Each team in their half-inning gets three outs. An out can come from: (1) a strikeout, where the batter fails to put the ball into play - more later about strikeouts. The second way to record an out is ground-out, where the ball is hit on the ground and the defensive player either (2a) tags the player with the ball either with the glove hand if the ball is in the glove, or with the ball in the non-glove hand, or (2b) throws to a base where a runner is forced to run and the player who catches the ball touches the base with any part of his body (perhaps a toe).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of a pathetic ground-out that was an embarrassment to even the player\u0026rsquo;s mom and grandma.\nThe third way to record an out is a fly-out (3a) to the outfield or a pop-out (3b) to the infield. In this case, the ball is hit in the air and caught by a player without touching the ground.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s possible to get more than one out per play, for example a triple play, where all three outs of the inning are recorded in one play. It\u0026rsquo;s not very common. Double plays are more common and a great way to kill your team\u0026rsquo;s momentum by canceling out baserunners.\nSo three outs to a half-inning, and three ways to make an out. If you\u0026rsquo;re a baserunner, you can also make an out by being tagged out when you aren\u0026rsquo;t touching the base. But let\u0026rsquo;s skip that for now.\n  EXCEPT: ground-outs (out-type #2) must be inside the field of play, or between the painted white lines that are first and third base.\n  EXCEPT: Fly-outs (3a) and pop-outs (3b) can be either fair or foul - basically anywhere the players can reach, including the stands.\n  EXCEPT EXCEPT: According to the \u0026ldquo; infield fly rule\u0026rdquo;, if there are one or more runners on bases that would be forced to run when the ball is hit, and the ball is hit in the air near enough to the runners that the fielder could drop the ball on purpose or pretend to fail to catch the ball, or actually fail to catch the ball, so as to create a double or triple play, than the umpire can call the hitter out and the runners are allowed to stay on their base.\n  EXCEPT EXCEPT: Foul balls in the air that are first caught by a fan do not count as outs.\n   EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT: If the ball is touched by a fan in the field of play, and affects the course of the game, the umpire can decide what to do. It\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo; spectator interference\u0026rdquo; and as stadiums have recently been built to put fans close to the action, it happens often.  One infamous example prolonged the 71 year-old \u0026ldquo; Curse of the Billy Goat\u0026rdquo; on the Chicago Cubs, and made Steve Bartman a pariah in Chicago. Did I mention that baseball players and fans are superstitious? Did you know if you wear a \u0026ldquo; rally cap\u0026rdquo;, you can impact the outcome of the game from the sidelines?\nWith all those exceptions, the one thing is constant. A half-inning has three outs. Right?\n EXCEPT: An inning can have a four outs. I had never heard of this rule, so I asked a serious baseball fan.  Let\u0026rsquo;s skip this one.\n3 strikes Balls thrown by the pitcher are categorized by the home-plate umpire as either balls or strikes. You may have heard the clich√© Three strikes and you\u0026rsquo;re out. A batter is indeed out if they have three from the following:\n  swing and miss\n  swing and hit the ball out of play (a.k.a. foul ball)\n  don\u0026rsquo;t swing but the pitch is determined a strike by the umpire, for passing over the home-plate between the knees and chest-high \u0026ldquo;letters\u0026rdquo; of the hitter.\n  Well, that\u0026rsquo;s true most of the time.\n  EXCEPT: The batter is not out if the 3rd strike is a foul ball. The first two strikes can come from foul balls, but the third strike can\u0026rsquo;t come from a foul ball. And the hitter can remain hitting as long as they can hit foul balls. Baseball again approaches the infinite.\n  EXCEPT EXCEPT: If 3rd strike is made with a bunting attempt, specifically running a hand up the bat to tap the ball into the field of play, and that bunted attempt goes foul, then the 3rd strike counts and an out is recorded.\n  EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT: If the 3rd strike is recorded and the catcher, who catches the ball thrown by the pitcher, drops or misses the ball, then the batter is entitled to run to first base, and the catcher or another defense player may try to throw the ball to first base. If a position player tags first base with the ball before the hitter reaches first base, then the out is recored. Otherwise, no out is recorded and the hitter remains at first base.\n  EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT: If first base is already occupied, then the batter may not attempt to reach first base.\n  EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT: If first base is occupied, but if there are already two outs, then the batter may attempt to reach first base, and the previous occupant of first base must attempt to advance to second base.\n  EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT: to quote directly from the rulebook\n   Rule 5.09(a)(2) Comment: A batter who does not realize his situation on a third strike not caught, and who is not in the process of running to first base, shall be declared out once he leaves the dirt circle surrounding home plate\n The rule is called \u0026ldquo; the dropped third strike\u0026rdquo;, if you insist to know more. Here\u0026rsquo;s the full 184 page rulebook ( pdf), in case you can stand any more.\nThe rulebook contains such thrilling excerpts as:\n **3.07 Pitcher‚Äôs Glove(a) The pitcher‚Äôs glove may not, exclusive of piping, be white,gray, nor, in the judgment of an umpire, distracting in any manner. No fielder, regardless of position, may use a fielding glove that falls within a PANTONE¬Æ color set lighter than the current 14-series.\n hit-by-pitch If the batter is hit by the pitched ball, then he/she is awarded first base.\n  EXCEPT: if umpire determines that the pitch was a strike, despite hitting the batter. This means that it was over the plate and between the knees and the \u0026ldquo;letters\u0026rdquo;. In this case, a strike is called.\n  EXCEPT: if the batter swings at a pitch, even if it still hits him/her.\n  EXCEPT: if the umpire determines that the batter did not make an effort to avoid being hit by the pitch.\n  the unwritten rules Wikipedia has an entire article about the unwritten rules of baseball. Many are about respecting the game, and violating the rules can get cause the opposing pitcher to intentionally hit one of your players with the ball.\n EXCEPT: the pitcher shouldn\u0026rsquo;t throw at the head of the hitter  In turn, throwing at a hitter can also cause a bench-clearing brawl. I don\u0026rsquo;t condone violence, but all I can say is that if you charge the mound, at least know the skills of the player you are going after.\n make it stop At this point, you may feel like you are in a headlock and being punched repeatedly in the head. Let\u0026rsquo;s agree that it\u0026rsquo;s easier to ignore all the rules, written and unwritten, and their exceptions, and their exceptions to their exceptions. We can still enjoy the game. Go to a stadium, enjoy the summer weather, cheer with the fans, eat a hot dog, drink a beer, and if you do all of this in in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, you may even get to see sausages in a footrace.\n   want to know more?

I never got a license. It\u0026rsquo;s been ten years since I did my fifteen measly jumps.\nBut those few weeks of ground school, pre-instructed then video-analyzed jumps, and those several thousand bucks, provided both professional and personal lessons that I\u0026rsquo;ve thought about nearly every day since then ‚Äì and hopefully put to some use. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably never skydive again, but the effect on my outlook has been long-lasting.\n1. Slow down Skydiving is as safe as the equipment and the mindset of the jumper. New students memorize how to methodically check the equipment before boarding the plane. We were told to memorize the motion for pulling the ripcord. We were taught to mentally visualize the landing pattern. Checklists are known to improve certain detailed processes, such as surgery and aviation. In skydiving, I felt safe because I could trust the equipment that I had methodically checked.\nSkydiving is actually safe, and has gotten a lot safer in recent years. According to the United States Parachute Association (USPA), in 2018, there were 13 fatalities for an estimate 3.3 million jumps in the US. That\u0026rsquo;s 3.9 deaths per million jumps. And according to the USPA, tandem skydiving is even safer, with two deaths per million jumps.\nData source: USPA\nSkydivers are an enthusiastic group, and especially for the skydiver-tourists who have a limited amount of time at the dropzone, you try to maximize the number of jumps while the weather and winds are good. This means as soon as your feet hit the ground, you run to the parachute packing area, quickly pack, and get back to the plane before it takes off again. But if it\u0026rsquo;s a safe dropzone and they see you running to the plane, they will not let you board. And for good reason. Incorrect equipment usage is a major cause of skydiving fatalities, including some things so basic as not inserting one\u0026rsquo;s legs into the harness, or even mistaking video equipment for a parachute, multiple times.\n \u0026ldquo;The harness McGuire wore for the video equipment is similar to that of a parachute. It has the same feel.\u0026rdquo;\n My Takeaway: Being methodical in preparation is a valuable skill. Use checklists to decrease the chances of missing something small but critical. Checklists also decrease your overall cognitive load.\n2. Relax in stressful situations At some point, every student has to make their first solo jump. As soon as I exited the plane, my first subconscious reaction was Panic. My body went rigid. I spun out of control, rotating through free fall. If you open your parachute with this type of movement, there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance it gets twisted or tangled and you\u0026rsquo;ll have a hard landing. Opening is better than not-opening, but opening dangerously when you are not stabilized can often lead to serious injury or death. In my first solo jump, until I stabilized, I believed I was going to crash to the ground in an uncontrolled spin.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how it looks to not be stabilized:\nI had this exact internal dialog after 5 eternal seconds of uncontrollable aerial rotations:\n What needs to be done?\n  ¬†Stabilize the body.\n  How does one achieve that?\n  ¬†The body must relax.\n That realization was an electrocution. To survive, my conscious brain quickly took over from my flailing body. As soon as my body relaxed, it snapped into a safer, stabilized position (although still lacking technique).\nMy Takeaway: Try to regularly take measure of a \u0026ldquo;relaxation-status\u0026rdquo;. If not calm, don\u0026rsquo;t do anything else except take steps to achieve calmness.\n3. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly use technology I was sitting at the pre-boarding zone, getting geared-up and ready to board. Skydivers wear altimeters on their hand, to easily monitor the altitude during the jump, so you know when to pull the ripcord. As I put the altimeter on my hand, it dropped from knee-hight to the ground. No big deal, right?\nWrong. An instructor happened to see the altimeter fall, and worse, he saw that I put it on after it fell. He walked over to me and asked me if I was planning to use it. When I said Yes, he asked me to give him the altimeter, and brought me another to use. His thinking, which was 100% correct, was that if there is a miniscule chance that the altimeter was broken or mis-calibrated in the fall, it could mean an accident. The instructor then wore my potentially-broken altimeter in addition to his own, and confirmed after his jump that it was still working correctly.\nMy Takeaway: Know when to not trust the technology, and when the technology needs to be tested. This is especially important on analytical projects, where a result needs to be understood in the context of the data. The worst thing one can do is to make a business case on a faulty analytical presumption.\n4. Waiting may be better The \u0026ldquo;stress\u0026rdquo; of skydiving actually causes a hormone response:\n Higher post-jump happiness predicted faster cortisol recovery after jumping\u0026hellip;\n And it\u0026rsquo;s not even just beginner skydivers:\n Intriguingly, even after hundreds of prior exposures, the experienced jumpers still showed a significant cortisol response to the jump\u0026hellip;\n (Source: Experience, cortisol reactivity, and the coordination of emotional responses to skydiving\nAfter my Advanced Free Fall course was complete, I was on my flight back home from the dropzone in Spain. The buzz of new addiction was overwhelming. I did some back-of-the-envelope math to calculate how many jumps I could afford if I quit my job and cashed-in my modest life savings.\nThankfully, the hormonal response eventually dulled, and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t overcome by a skydiving addiction. (Not that there\u0026rsquo;s anything wrong with it.)\nMy Takeaway: Waiting to plan is not so good, but waiting to act is perfectly fine. Don\u0026rsquo;t feel pressured to act. It\u0026rsquo;s better to wait until all the information is known, or in this case, until the hormonal response has worn off.\nAn example from my professional life: I worked for an energy utility, and one task was the responsibility for the data-compliance of a European Union regulatory-framework. The deadlines were clear, but as they slowly approached, the exact implementation wasn\u0026rsquo;t getting any clearer. I decided to wait. We were a small player in the market, and I was confident the big Swiss players would iron out the details. The internal response was not so positive, and some may have said that I was procrastinating. But when the deadline arrived, we were fully compliant, and without an over-engineered solution.\n Ten years later We\u0026rsquo;ve packed ourselves like sardines, I\u0026rsquo;m nervously sweating in a roaring, ascending plane. The engine noise becomes slightly quieter: the climb is over. Light blinks from red to green. In floods the burst of cold air as the plane door slides open. Observe as the experienced skydivers fall gracefully from the open door. Wait for my turn (at the end with the other beginners).\nTen years later, these thoughts still make my stomach turn in knots ‚Äì my moment to jump steadily approaches.\nAnd for your entertainment, here\u0026rsquo;s the video of my first solo jump:\n   Why not go for a jump?

And if only a handful of people need part-time now, keep reading, because as automation, robotics, AI and virtual offshoring continue to grow, our part-time community will grow, too.\nthe robots are coming A recent article Are Robots Competing for your Job? ( New Yorker, Feb. 25, 2019) does a great job of condensing some economic theories and the potential displacement of workers from all sectors of the workforce. (Quotes below are from this article.)\npoint 1: white-collar jobs will be displaced, too If the job isn\u0026rsquo;t replaced by a robot or algorithm, it can be what the article calls and \u0026ldquo;augmented immigrant\u0026rdquo;.\n ‚Äúthis international talent tidal wave is coming straight for the good, stable jobs that have been the foundation of middle-class prosperity in the US and Europe, and other high-wage economies.‚Äù\n Perfect example: A few weeks ago a news story went viral: a doctor informed a patient of a terminal diagnosis via remote video chat.\npoint 2: jobs that can\u0026rsquo;t be displaced won\u0026rsquo;t be paid better  The catch is that, historically, caring, sharing, understanding, and empathizing with people who are in the same room as you has been the work of women, and is therefore either unpaid, and not recognized as work, or paid very badly. Childcare, elementary-school teaching, nursing, geriatric care, and social work will not suddenly become high-paying, high-prestige professions simply because everything else is done by robots.\n It\u0026rsquo;s anecdata, but I\u0026rsquo;ve observed that the jobs advertised as part-time are often in these poorly paid \u0026ldquo;care\u0026rdquo; jobs, which uncoincidentally \u0026ldquo;has been the work of women\u0026rdquo;. But that\u0026rsquo;s another story for another time\u0026hellip;\npoint 3: it\u0026rsquo;s not the immigrants  And a study published last summer in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy‚Äîwhose lead author, Carl Frey, is the same guy who made the list of the seven hundred and two most computerizable jobs‚Äîargues that the robot caravan got Trump elected. Measuring the density of robots and comparing them with election returns, Frey and his colleagues found that ‚Äúelectoral districts that became more exposed to automation during the years running up to the election were more likely to vote for Trump.‚Äù\n From that aforementioned list, the jobs displaced due to automation are office admin, sales and service, most of which fall in the \u0026ldquo;high risk employment\u0026rdquo; category.

At the time, my boss offered my same job but part-time (2 days per week, or 40%). With the benefit of hindsight, the single biggest mistake in my career was to decline that offer. But at the time, I privately wanted something else: less time in the office, and more free-time both with and without the kids. Since then, the startup has gone stagnant. My bank account has emptied. I\u0026rsquo;m drowning in free-time. The time to get a job was months ago.\nthe job market The unemployment rate in Switzerland is one of the lowest in Europe. I\u0026rsquo;ve marked the Swiss unemployment compared to all worldwide countries in the dataviz below.\nsource: Wikipedia\nAnd for data-sciency people like me, with a PhD in computational physics, years of experience in business intelligence and data science, and programming and databases and data visualization reporting and business development, with strong references from every previous position, the job market is strong and the effective unemployment rate is 0.0%.\nNo problem, right?\nchoosing part-time Full-time employment in Switzerland is 8.5 hours per day, for a total of 42.5 hours per week. We call it here \u0026ldquo;100%\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty common for jobs to be offered at 80%-100%. Because salaries for tech jobs are relatively high, even those without kids should enjoy a weekday free.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve decided to work part time - no more than 60%.\nfamily I have two healthy kids who still like to spend time with me, and who are rapidly growing up. Part-time affords me the flexibility to cover for the many school holidays, events, meetings. (The city of Z√ºrich has 13 calendar weeks of school vacation and all sorts of other holidays scattered throughout the year.) We live in affordable housing in the city of Z√ºrich, a Wohnungsbaugenossenschaft ( EN, DE). I have a partner who likes to work, and earns well too. What a great place to be.\nfree-time Some free-time should be without the kids around.\n  Trips to the (non-kids) library.\n  Reading books and magazines, doing crossword puzzles.\n  Browsing the second-hand stores.\n  Gardening in the backyard.\n  Projects around the house.\n  Rediscover old hobbies, and discover new ones.\n  health   To work on my #dadbod.\n  To swim laps in a 50m pool.\n  To take my slow time on long forest walks.\n  To take a nap.\n  Avoid rushing around.\n  To prevent a burnout.\n  current status: bored I have it good: family and free-time.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s missing: a paying job. And teamwork and office comradery. And a reason to put on pants.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve applied to around 50 jobs over the past few months and have had a good rate of interest and interviews.\nBut the lurking secret? None of these jobs was advertised in my sweet spot: 40% - 60%.\nproductivity doesn\u0026rsquo;t scale! I\u0026rsquo;m an abstract and creative thinker. Employers like me because I think out of the box, because I challenge the status quo, and because I deliver. Productivity for this kind of non-operational work doesn\u0026rsquo;t scale to 42.5 office hours per week. Somewhere between 60% and 100% is my productivity drop-off.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a dataviz that shows a theoretical productivity drop with increasing hours per work week. The \u0026ldquo;email zone\u0026rdquo; is where the operational tasks take up the entire working time. The \u0026ldquo;search for vacation zone\u0026rdquo; is where I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be. And what I offer my future employer is to pay me less, and then get me only when I\u0026rsquo;m maximally efficient.\nBut\u0026hellip; hiring is a long-term exercise in risk avoidance. If any one candidate brings a complication, the hiring team will usually go with the safe bet to avoid any future criticism. It\u0026rsquo;s the same unspoken selling-point of the Big Four consulting companies: Choose us, because even when we fail, no one will second guess you.\nthe challenge moving forward It turns out that there are literally zero open jobs that fit my description. There are a handful of part-time developer jobs, and although I like writing code, my strength is prototyping and analysis, and not shipping apps and websites. There is a handful of part-time jobs for interns or students (I\u0026rsquo;ve even applied for some of those). I\u0026rsquo;ve tried remote jobs and Upwork, and although neither is panning out, and it would be hard to match a Swiss salary. In the meantime, I\u0026rsquo;m working on some small freelance projects, but for personal reasons, I don\u0026rsquo;t actively pursue freelance projects. (Note: I offer my services to NGOs at either heavily discounted rates or even free, in the case that I support in their mission.)\nI still interview for full-time jobs, and I don\u0026rsquo;t forewarn interviewers of my part-time job requirement. In general, until I have an offer, I try my hardest to not give any reason to not hire me. I do mention that my previous jobs were at 80%, because I have one regular weekday at home with the kids. In one recent interview, they asked Are you flexible? I answered Yes, I\u0026rsquo;d also be open to 60%.

Or is it Adviser? Or is it both? Let\u0026rsquo;s take a data-journey for one word with two spellings. In English, an agent noun is how a verb is transformed into the thing doing that action. For example, a swimmer swims and a player plays. To convert a verb into an agent noun, it\u0026rsquo;s typical to add -er. But -or works, too, primarily for words derived from Latin. And -ist is sometimes used, often for verbs ending in -ize (e.g. apologist).\nOriginally, adviser was the one true spelling. It was only recently, at the start of the 20th century, that advisor began its ascent, and it will be only a few more years into the 21st before it overtakes adviser.\nHistorically, there have been more advisers than advisors. That says nothing about the quality of the advice.\nsource: Google Books N-gram Viewer\nInterestingly, some early instances of advisor are due to mistakes in reading the scanned pages, called OCR (optical character recognition). In this 1869 case it could have been the hand-drawn \u0026ldquo;firewood\u0026rdquo; typeface that confused the algorithm.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s often claimed that American English writers use advisor while British English writers use adviser‚Äîand the data below seems to agree. Counting instances in American English, advisor (blue) and adviser (red) are about equal in 2008, the most recent year that is available. In British English, advisor (green) is gaining in popularity but adviser (orange) is still preferred. Seems straightforward, right?\nFewer advisors in the UK (source).\nBut wait, there\u0026rsquo;s more! Advisor in the States is far from the default \u0026ndash; the NY Times and Associated Press insist on adviser, while the Federal Government goes with advisor. Separately searching for adviser and advisor on individual websites for well-known institutions in the US and the UK, we can approximate which spelling is more common. As an indicator, let\u0026rsquo;s use the ratio of advisor-results to adviser-results: the \u0026ldquo;o/e ratio\u0026rdquo;. An o/e ratio greater than one means that advisor returns more results; less than one and adviser is more commonly found.\nUK university websites use each spelling about equally. US university websites go heavy on advisor. (One exception is my PhD university, RPI, which has a low o/e ratio that approaches the \u0026ldquo;NY Times abyss.\u0026quot;)\nNot only is the debate not clearly split on geographical lines, there may not even be a debate. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just a semantic stubbornness that creates a misplaced superiority and leaves the rest of us confused. This guy falls uncomfortably hard on one side of the advisor/adviser debate.\nBut with deplorable comma usage\nAnd this guy falls comfortably on both sides of the debate. A true Quantum Twitterer.\nSo what? There may be a small non-geographical distinction, actually. The Grammarist, Wiktionary, and a guy who wrote a comment on a blog make the minor distinction, and I\u0026rsquo;ll summarize:\nadvisor is a title, and adviser is anyone else who advises and is not already an advisor. The data backs up this claim. By selecting only capitalized Advisor and Adviser, the -or spelling has already passed -er. To capitalize Advisor indicates a title, and its dominance compared to Adviser suggests that there is indeed a distinction, albeit tiny.\nCapitalized Advisor/Adviser starting a sentence does not influence this result, see here.\nSo, how does 2014 tech society handle ambiguity? At the time of writing, Wikipedia has a link for adviser but shows the page for advisor. A great side effect of having separate pages with the same content is the possibility to compare page views for each spelling. For all of 2013, the advisor page received 100,361 page views, while adviser 4,165. See the chart below for the 2008-2014 weekly page views.\nWikipedia page views per calendar week, for Advisor (blue) and Adviser (red).\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s even more interesting for Wikipedia is that there are many specific types advisers with their own page, and many advisors with their own page. And some types of advisors redirect to advisers. And other types of advisers redirect to advisors. For example, \u0026ldquo;Financial advisor\u0026rdquo; redirects to \u0026ldquo;Financial adviser\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Technical adviser\u0026rdquo; redirects to \u0026ldquo;Technical advisor\u0026rdquo;. This is despite the fact that \u0026ldquo;Financial advisor\u0026rdquo; is a much more prevalent phrase than \u0026ldquo;Financial adviser\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Technical adviser\u0026rdquo; is a more prevalent phrase than \u0026ldquo;Technical advisor\u0026rdquo;, as we\u0026rsquo;ll soon discover.\nBoth the standard dictionaries, the Oxford English Dictionary and the American Merriam-Webster, have links for advisor but show the main spelling as adviser. Interestingly, if you search directly at m-w.com, the o/e-neutral page for advise comes up, which seems to equally frustrate everyone (e.g. the comments).\nThesaurus.com show many more results for advisor. The first synonym listed is another victim of careless machine learning and is blazingly incorrect‚Äîadviser! Then, to make matters worse, the adviser page doesn\u0026rsquo;t show advisor as a synonym.\nTripadviser.com has a redirect to tripadvisor.com. And good thing for the redirect‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthere are still 10,400 Google results for tripadviser.com. (It\u0026rsquo;s common for large sites to buy domains of common spelling errors and typos, e.g. twittter.com). Here is an example of one Twitter user fighting for his/her semantic preference. Or maybe it was that pesky autocorrect, also guilty of forgetting the apostrophe in \u0026ldquo; cant\u0026rdquo;.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s dig deeper and see what the data says.\n(please visit the Code Section for further description \u0026amp; links to codes)\nOn Twitter, it\u0026rsquo;s not straightforward to count the number of tweets that are found with a search term. Doing so required some mini-mining with the Twitter API and a snippet of Python code. I downloaded tweets that have either advisor or adviser and then counted each separately. Going back in time one week, there were 50,165 times that the case-insensitive advisor was used, compared to 23,016 for adviser, corresponding to an o/e ratio of 2.2. Counting only instances of capitalized Advisor and Adviser, their counts were 25,383 and 7,825, respectively. With an increased o/e ratio of 3.2, the predominance of capitalized Advisor indicates a title or a role, as described above. By putting the tweets with public geo-location on the world map, with advisor in blue and adviser in red, nothing really stands out. But it\u0026rsquo;s sometimes fun to click and see what people around the world are saying about their advisors and their advisers?\nClick here for the interactive version.\nWord clouds, which are normally pretty useless, show some distinctions between the spellings. Employment terms such as job, sales, financial, customer, and service are commonly found in tweets containing advisor. Tweets with adviser include more political terms, such as legal, national, security, and president. I guess word clouds are still pretty useless.\nFinally, tweets are filtered by emotion, literally by adding a smiley or frowny face to the Twitter search string. Happy tweets over one week were well-balanced: 477 advisors and 593 advisers (0.8 o/e ratio, which is much fewer non-filtered tweets). In sad tweets, advisor showed up 48 times, compared to 157 for adviser (0.3 o/e ratio). It\u0026rsquo;s not a huge number of tweets and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make any dramatic conclusions, such as claiming that \u0026ldquo;advisers are more polarizing than advisors.\u0026rdquo;\nEt tu, Goo-gle? At the time of writing, Google approximated 119,000,000 results for advisor and only 20,500,000 for adviser. That\u0026rsquo;s a very large o/e ratio of 5.8. Despite that lopsidedness, only adviser brings up a definition box. (For a short discussion about using approximate Google search results, see Appendix 1.)\nWelcome to my cozy little filter bubble.\nBy using approximate results from Google search, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to build an understanding of which spelling is preferred in certain contexts. For example, searching \u0026ldquo;Financial Advisor\u0026rdquo; with quotes returns 5,120,000 results and \u0026ldquo;Financial Adviser\u0026rdquo; returns 1,480,000. (For the methodology of term collection, see Appendix 2.) In addition to well known roles like \u0026ldquo;Academic Advisor\u0026rdquo;, I\u0026rsquo;ve added some general adjectives, such as \u0026ldquo;trusted\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo;.\nThe interactive visualization is available here.\nThe results are‚Ä¶ complicated. \u0026ldquo;Financial advisor\u0026rdquo; is the most common. \u0026ldquo;Afraid adviser\u0026rdquo; is the least. \u0026ldquo;Stock adviso/er\u0026rdquo; has the highest o/e ratio (185.7). Categories consistently with more advisors than advisers are academic, business and health. Despite the US Government\u0026rsquo;s preference for advisor, most political advisers use the -er spelling.\nSearch phrases with an o/e ratio of less than 1.0 are most interesting because there are, in general, fewer advisers than advisors online. Even more interesting is if those advisers include American-specific spellings, because adviser is often considered the British spelling. And even more interesting is if that type of adviser includes the American spelling. The double-American spelling of \u0026ldquo;jewelry advisor\u0026rdquo; has more results than the British/American mix-match of \u0026ldquo;jewellery advisor\u0026rdquo;, which has more results than the double-British \u0026ldquo;jewellery adviser\u0026rdquo;. All of those are dwarfed by \u0026ldquo;Jewelry adviser\u0026rdquo;, by far the most popular choice, and because of that dominance, \u0026ldquo;jewelry adviso/er\u0026rdquo; has the second lowest o/e ratio.\nAll the British English spellings land above the 1.0 o/e ratio line.\nMaybe there is no answer.\nWhere do we go from here? I took a look in my past in order to see where to go in my future. In my personal and professional life, after scanning 10 years, 8gb and 56,019 sent emails, the count is:\n adviser, 70 times, in 57 emails\n  advisor, 48 times, in 40 emails\n ‚Ä¶and I\u0026rsquo;ve never posted a review on tripadvisor.com OR tripadviser.com. As a reference, I\u0026rsquo;ve used the word ‚Äòthe' 113,517 times in 15,264 emails.\nRelax. Both spellings are fine for all purposes. The general rule says you stick with one spelling in one document. But who owns that rule, anyway? I think it\u0026rsquo;s time to fully embrace the ambiguity. I want to live in a world where the spell-checker randomly reassigns your already correct spelling to another correct spelling. We\u0026rsquo;ll call it the Quantum Spellcorrector and we\u0026rsquo;ll laugh about back-in-the-day when it mattered.\n  Appendix 1. Although extremely approximate and fluctuating, many language learners use the number of Google results to determine what sounds more natural. For example, in German, gern and gerne are interchangeable, and mean \u0026ldquo;gladly\u0026rdquo;. Despite that, native speakers will often converge on one spelling in one certain context.\nMore popular by a factor of Zwei.\nLess popular, although what comes after must surely matter.\nInterestingly, Google\u0026rsquo;s N-grams tool indicate that gerne has recently passed gern in popularity.\n source\nWhich is good, because I prefer gerne. I think it makes my German sound Italian. Ich h√§tte gerne eine pizza.\nNow, who knows the literary reason for the bump in the popularity of gerne in the late 1940s? I\u0026rsquo;ll post any good guesses here:\n Discussion based on my question to german.stackexchange.com. No concrete answer yet, but a link to a similar finding for another set of words. It seems to be a coincidence. ___________________   Appendix 2.

My wife had another year to finish her PhD, so I took a sabbatical to be a stay-at-home dad. My months away from research were intended to be full of fun projects. And relaxation. It was to be the Year of Naps ‚Äì or so I thought.\nUnfortunately, while physics problems have solutions that are constant, baby-related problems have solutions that are random and change from day to day. What had worked yesterday will not work today. Maybe it will work tomorrow. This is the gist of the Baby Universe. In this universe, time only means a start and a finish, and contains no information in-between. If the physicist-dad discovers a method to get the baby to eat her breakfast, it is unlikely to work by dinner. This is significant because eating is one of four fundamental dimensions of the Baby Universe, and the same principle of random solutions also applies to the other three: playing, crying and sleeping. (Some scientists consider pooping to be a separate dimension. However, I can assure you that this is always included as part of one of the other four.)\nPhoto credit : Sarah Perry\nThe first challenge in my physicist-to-dad transition came with my inability to feed my daughter naturally. My thesis-writing wife\u0026rsquo;s fresh-pumped milk was in demand and its administration required complex algorithms for its optimal, timely use. Solid food, once introduced, posed a whole new set of problems, as each spoonful required extensive parental coercion. This may have had its upsides: recent research shows that the more you talk to your child, the higher the child\u0026rsquo;s IQ will be. The fine print that the researchers don\u0026rsquo;t mention is that this IQ boost comes at your expense, as you must donate those IQ points to the child via non-stop one-way conversations: \u0026ldquo;Look. Yams. Mmmmm. You like yams. You liked yams yesterday. Oooh, yaaaaaams.\u0026rdquo;\nLater, my daughter acquired a rudimentary ability to feed herself, and the physics of the eating dimension became more complex. If I offer her a spoonful of food, she comes running to see what is on the spoon. If the food is not to her liking, she is scattered like a charged particle from a similarly charged hard sphere. But when, instead, a sticky ball of white rice is presented to her, it triggers a primal urge to make chaos. The \u0026ldquo;entropy of rice\u0026rdquo; principle dictates that the dispersion of rice across a 2D \u0026ldquo;table\u0026rdquo; is sudden, yet erratic. After adequate time, every grain of rice is scattered into a circle with a radius equal to one baby arm. Given infinite time, it is predicted that babies would not rest until every grain of rice was at every end of the universe.\nPhoto credit : Debby Shemella, aka Grandma (2012)\nAs the preceding paragraph indicates, the \u0026ldquo;eating\u0026rdquo; dimension of the Baby Universe is closely coupled to the \u0026ldquo;playing\u0026rdquo; dimension. Before she could crawl or walk, my daughter would nevertheless want to change her position during playtime. She employed the theory of relativity to satisfy this urge: by moving her playmat from underneath her, she could therefore move herself off the mat. Once mobile, she liked to increase her potential energy by dragging herself up and onto whatever obstacle she could find. If stairs existed, that obstacle was most definitely stairs. This is unfortunate, because although babies understand gravity if they are dropping something (and can even anticipate the \u0026ldquo;Boom!\u0026rdquo; the object makes upon impact), they have no comprehension of gravity if they are the body upon which it is acting. It is therefore the physicist-parent\u0026rsquo;s job to decrease the baby\u0026rsquo;s potential energy whenever it grows too large, and it is the baby\u0026rsquo;s work to regain what was taken away.\n  The PechaKucha talk that started this research.\nThe two remaining dimensions of the Baby Universe‚Ää\u0026ndash;‚Ääcrying and sleeping‚Ää\u0026ndash;‚Ääare also tightly coupled. To deal with daytime crying sessions, I devised a \u0026ldquo;terror threat level\u0026rdquo; system of graded responses, with passivation techniques such as singing, dancing, guitar and something I copied from Monty Python\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Ministry of Silly Walks\u0026rdquo;. For inducing sleep, I adopted similarly complex patterns of rocking, bouncing, walking, singing, shushing and waiting. Some of these patterns involved a Swiss ball ‚Äì a large, inflated exercise ball that serves as a rocking chair for the 21st century. This ball has harmonic degrees of freedom in the side-to-side and front-to-back directions as well as the primary up-and-down one, and is essential for bouncing and rocking a baby to sleep. In addition, it is good for the physicist-parent\u0026rsquo;s core strength, and can be easily deflated and packed up before relocating for yet another postdoc.\nOnce the baby is asleep, the physicist-parent is faced with the challenge of escaping the room‚Ää\u0026ndash;‚Ääin my case over creaky hardwood floors. Doing this before my daughter realizes she is asleep requires knowledge of the \u0026ldquo;path of least noise\u0026rdquo;. Once I have exited the room, though, I have a dilemma. No sounds come from the crib. Is my daughter asleep or awake? A measurement is required. As I silently slide on my socks into the dark room, my measurement wakes her and her original state remains unknown. This is Schr√∂dinger\u0026rsquo;s baby.\nMy time at home has been a great period in my life and I know I will miss this when I\u0026rsquo;m back at work. As I write this essay in my head, my daughter rests on my shoulder. Her breathing turns to snoring and I synchronize my own breathing to be in phase with hers. Together we plan all the things I need to do during her naptime. I definitely don\u0026rsquo;t have time for a nap of my own.\n The author and his muse (2013)\n This article is also available on Medium.\n","date":1389225600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1389225600,"objectID":"ce4c1357f55309a7f2e5bfe06858fd33","permalink":"https://smalldata.github.io/posts/physics-of-babies/","publishdate":"2014-01-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posts/physics-of-babies/","section":"posts","summary":"This article was originally published in Physics World September 2013, copyright IOP Publishing, reproduced here with permission.\n I became a first-time father around the same time my postdoc contract ended.","tags":["family","thoughts","fun"],"title":"Life in the Baby Universe: The Physics of Babies","type":"posts"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Photo credit: Flicker:binaryape\n A datum is a single piece of information.
